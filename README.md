## Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I used a few key tools:

- **Python**: this was the main tool for analyzing the data and finding important insights. I also used some python libraries:
  - **Pandas**: to handle and analyze the data.
  - **Matplotlib**: to create basic graphs and charts.
  - **Seaborn**: to make more advanced and detailed visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:i used this to run my Python scripts and keep track of my notes and analysis in one place.
- **Visual Studio Code**: this was my main editor for running my python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: i used these for managing changes to my code and sharing my work, which helped with collaboration and tracking progress.
